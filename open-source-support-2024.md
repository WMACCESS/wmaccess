## Caddy

We're continuously sponsoring the Caddy project, expressing our gratitude and support towards the Caddy community and maintainers for delivering a top-notch web server. This web server is not just a tool; it's a valuable asset in our tech stack, promising a secure, efficient web serving experience. A massive thank you to the Caddy community for this outstanding open-source contribution! üôè

Steffen Busch - WMACCESS Product Manager:
> We successfully integrated Caddy into our production environment in January 2024. The launch of our new tech stack with Caddy has been a significant milestone, greatly assisted by its superb, up-to-date documentation. As we continue to optimize our systems, we're excited about the upcoming enablement of HTTP/3 in the following weeks, promising even greater performance and efficiency.

## Louis Lam with Uptime Kuma

We recognize [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) as a pivotal tool in enhancing server monitoring and downtime alerts üö®.
This modern, user-friendly tool boasts a fantastic web user interface and offers a diverse range of highly configurable monitoring types.
[Louis Lam](https://github.com/louislam), the developer behind Uptime Kuma, has created a tool that is an essential supplement to other external monitoring services, allowing for comprehensive oversight and operational efficiency.

We are proud to support Uptime Kuma, helping to further its development and ensuring it remains a valuable asset for developers and system administrators worldwide üåç.

## lnav (Log File Navigator)

[lnav](https://lnav.org/) üõ†Ô∏è from [Tim Stack](https://github.com/tstack/lnav) is a powerful tool for viewing and analyzing log files directly in the terminal. It offers:

- Log Highlighting: Highlights key elements from log entries, such as error messages, timestamps, and log levels, for better readability and faster analysis.
- Log File Merging: Combines multiple log files, even mixing compressed .gz files with uncompressed ones, for seamless analysis.
- Error and Warning Navigation: Quickly navigate to the next or previous error or warning, making it easy to pinpoint issues.
- Live Operation: Automatically updates with new log lines, searches as you type, and validates SQL queries in real time.
- Support for Various Formats: Recognizes a wide range of log formats and allows users to define custom formats for tailored analysis.

One feature we find particularly outstanding is its **ability to query log files using SQL**. This functionality allows us to analyze structured log formats, such as **JSON access logs from our Caddy web server**, with ease. This makes log analysis both intuitive and incredibly efficient.

We‚Äôre thrilled to support this tool and the efforts of its creator, Tim Stack. For the latest release updates and announcements, follow [lnav on X](https://x.com/lnavapp).

## Healthchecks ‚úÖ

[Healthchecks](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks) by [Pƒìteris Caune](https://github.com/cuu508) is an open-source service for monitoring recurring tasks like Cron jobs. It operates on the "Dead man's switch" principle, where systems regularly ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù to confirm everything is running smoothly. Missed check-ins trigger alerts üö® to ensure no critical task goes unnoticed.

We use the self-hosted version of Healthchecks to maintain full control and privacy over our monitoring setup. Cron jobs send their execution outputs directly to our instance of Healthchecks, where they are displayed in a user-friendly and highly functional web interface, offering a clear and organized view of the data.

A highlight from Healthchecks' developer, Pƒìteris Caune, is his **amazing blog post** about advanced Crontab configurations, such as scheduling tasks for the **second and fourth Sunday of a month**. This showcases the ingenuity and practical expertise behind the project. ([Read more here](https://blog.healthchecks.io/2022/09/schedule-cron-job-the-funky-way/))

## Continuation of open-source support in 2024 and beyond

We will continue to actively support incredible open-source projects in 2024, and we look forward to doing the same in the following years. We believe in the sustainability, growth, and innovative potential of open source, and will remain dedicated contributors to this invaluable ecosystem.

## A call to action

The open-source community thrives on the collective contributions of individuals and organizations. As the digital world continues to evolve, let us ensure that the foundations remain strong and innovative through our support.

We call upon companies and individuals to join us in this mission. Whether it is contributing code, reporting bugs, spreading the word, or providing financial support, every action counts.

Let‚Äôs celebrate and uplift the spirits of those who dedicate themselves to open source. Together, we can ensure that this remarkable community continues to flourish, innovate, and inspire generations to come.

_Thank you for being a part of this journey!_ üöÄ
