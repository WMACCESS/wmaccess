## 🤔 Why did we join GitHub?

Our primary motivation for joining GitHub is to facilitate financial support to the open-source community. Although we previously carried out financial support directly via project websites or developers' PayPal accounts, we recognized that GitHub's platform streamlines the process and enables us to actively participate in this vibrant community.

## 📘 Understanding open source

While many open-source projects are free to use, the term "free" extends beyond monetary cost. The essence of free software lies in freedom. As eloquently defined in 1986 by the GNU's Bulletin publication:

> The word "free" in our name does not refer to price; it refers to freedom.  
> First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.  
> Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.

## 🤝 Our position on open source

We are immensely grateful to the community and particularly the dedicated individuals who invest their time and effort in these open-source projects. Our GitHub open-source support project represents an evolution in how we engage. In the past, we've provided feedback and shared our knowledge, submitted feature requests and bug reports using our personal GitHub accounts, and we intend to continue these valuable contributions. However, our financial support has traditionally been facilitated through alternative channels. 
Now, we are leveraging GitHub to directly extend our financial contributions to the creators of exceptional open-source projects.

**CPB Software ❤️ open source**

## 📣 A call to action

We believe that open source is the backbone of innovation in technology. As more companies and individuals reap the benefits of open-source software, it is our collective responsibility to ensure its sustainability. We urge other companies to recognize the value and potentials of open-source contributions. By investing time, resources, and financial support into open source, we collectively foster an ecosystem of collaboration, innovation, and progress that benefits us all. Let's support the open-source community, for it is an investment in the future of technology.

Join us in this endeavor. **Let's make a difference together.** 🌟
