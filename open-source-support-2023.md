## Aristocratos and the fabulous btop

We are incredibly excited to support Jakob P. Liljenberg ([Aristocratos](https://github.com/aristocratos)) for his amazing contribution to the community with [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop).

`Btop` is a resource monitor that shows usage and stats for the processor, memory, disks, network and processes. We chose to support Aristocratos because `btop` stands out in its performance, feature set, and user-friendliness. We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Aristocratos for developing and maintaining btop. Your hard work is making a difference in the community.

Steffen Busch - WMACCESS Product Manager:
> I'm so excited about `btop` and I have tried many tools in that category, but `btop` is simply outstanding awesome. I run it 24/7 in a separate tmux window on all of my servers. No other tool shows so much information in such a distinguishable way, but still perfect to keep an eye on CPU, I/O, RAM and network traffic. It's indispensable when conducting load tests.

We highly recommend `btop` to anyone in need of a streamlined and robust system monitoring tool. Keep the innovation coming! üöÄ

## John McNamara with his awesome Excel Writer tools

We want to express our profound appreciation to [John McNamara](https://github.com/jmcnamara) for the invaluable [Excel Writer](https://github.com/jmcnamara?tab=repositories) tools in various programming languages.

WMACCESS uses the Excel Writer to generate the most beautiful and user-friendly Excel-Files, directly from our WMACCESS Database. These reports are sent to our customers.

John McNamara's dedication to maintaining and improving these tools is commendable. The WMACCESS team would like to extend a huge thank you to John for his contribution to the open-source community and the impact it has had on our services. We wholeheartedly recommend the Excel Writer tools to any team that requires advanced Excel capabilities in their workflow. Keep up the excellent work! üëè

## tmux

We'd like to extend our gratitude to the brilliant team behind [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

`tmux`, a terminal multiplexer, revolutionizes our work by allowing us to easily switch between various programs within a single terminal. It also grants us the capability to detach these programs (keeping them running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal, boosting our workflow efficiency significantly.

Our sincere thanks to the `tmux` team for providing this powerful tool to the open-source community. Keep up the excellent work!

## Dalance with procs

A round of applause to [@Dalance](https://github.com/dalance) for creating [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs), a fantastic `ps` replacement built with Rust.

`Procs` is not just an alternative; it's an upgrade. With its modern, colourful output, it provides a more user-friendly experience. Its performance-enhanced features enable us to efficiently monitor our SSH-Tunnels, Application Server, and other processes.

Steffen Busch - WMACCESS Product Manager:
> I love the ability to add additional columns on demand to the output of `procs` with `--insert TcpPort` or `--insert ElapsedTime` for example. BTW, neither of these columns are supported with the traditional `ps`, but these can be very useful.

We have found `procs` to be an essential part of our day-to-day operations, and we highly recommend it to those who wish to boost their system administration productivity. Thank you, Dalance, for your innovative contribution to the community!

## Sharkdp for bat, fd, and hexyl

A massive thank you to David Peter, aka [@sharkdp](https://github.com/sharkdp), for his many CLI tools such as, but not limited to, [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) and [hexyl](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl).

Each tool provides unique, user-friendly enhancements to classic Unix commands, transforming our day-to-day operations. `bat` is a `cat(1)` clone with wings, `fd` is a simpler and faster alternative to `find`, and `hexyl` is a user-friendly command-line hex viewer, incredibly useful for analysing low digits in files.

David, your contributions have made our workdays smoother, more productive and colorful. For that, we can't thank you enough!

## Junegunn for fzf

We are grateful to Junegunn Choi, aka [@junegunn](https://github.com/junegunn), for creating [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), a powerful, versatile command-line fuzzy finder.

`fzf` has bumped the efficiency of how we interact with the shell. It offers a unique approach to command-line interfaces, turning them into powerful interactive experiences. With its capability to work with any list and provide flexible layouts, `fzf` has quickly become one of our most valued tools. Thanks, Junegunn, for this wonderful contribution!

## Dandavison for delta

Our heartfelt thanks to [Dan Davison](https://github.com/dandavison) for [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta), a syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, and grep output.

`Delta` has become an indispensable tool for our team, particularly for file comparison tasks using diff or comparing command output from our primary and fallback server. Dan, your tool has significantly improved our workflow. We can't express enough how much we appreciate your hard work and contribution!

## acme.sh 

Our sincere appreciation goes to [Neil Pang](https://github.com/Neilpang), creator of [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh). This tool is more than just a shell script for [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate management; it's a one-stop solution for SSL management needs, supporting numerous platforms and DNS APIs.

In today's security-focused digital environment, having a robust, flexible, and easy-to-use SSL management tool like `acme.sh` is essential. Thank you Neil and the acme.sh team, for providing this must-have resource! üõ°Ô∏è

## Continuation of open-source support in 2023 and beyond

We will continue to actively support incredible open-source projects in 2023, and we look forward to doing the same in the following years. We believe in the sustainability, growth, and innovative potential of open source, and will remain dedicated contributors to this invaluable ecosystem.
